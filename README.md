## START WITH EVERYTHING

Your mind doesn't neatly categorize different items in order of what is the most impactful, in what sequence and how long something might take. Time can be both _time in the task_ but also _time thinking about the task._ For this reason you start with listing everything you can think of that should be done throughout the day. Fill up every bullet point and stop when you hit slack.

_Why is there a cross in each one?_ This serves as an estimate of time, treat each dot like a clock.  For 15 minutes or less, use the 3 o'clock position.  For 30 minutes use the 6 o'clock position, 45 minutes the 9 o'clock position and so on.  This gives reference to the big items that should be scheduled and the quick hits that you can knock out sooner.  
PLAN FOR THE UNKNOWN

*Plan to 70%.* Leaving that extra space for life to influence and guide will allow you to maintain your personal velocity while remaining flexible. Your 5am self does not know what your 5pm self will be focusing on. Unless of course its bourbon, then you can pencil that right in.
TOP 3

The left-hand side serves as a reminder of what you should do, but the right-hand side is your need to do. The top 3 serves as just that, but the shading indicates just how important the first thing is. Borrowing from the ONE THING book, this is the one task in the sea of maybes that will move the needle for the day. This is not the biggest or longest task that you might face during the day. It is the tire block that allows you to take flight.

## DAILY

What, if you did it each day, would make you healthier, wealthier and wise? The mundane, forgotten, meager and otherwise unassuming habits that build you into the person you should be if only you did them every day. For me, this comes in the form of:

    Mediation. Its called a practice for a reason.
    Brush your teeth. I constantly drink coffee on my way out, so something to change.
    Planks & Pushups. A body is a weight I can lift anywhere and should be able to do so. Always.
    Make your bed. Because some days you are a sand cookie.
    Curcumin. I am deathly afraid of losing my memory and it has been shown to help.
    Appreciations. Pause to appreciate my situation in life daily. Be humble.
    Element of play. Sometimes planning to have fun is the only way it will happen.
    Read a chapter. Learn a little bit every day. The compound interest of intelligence is enormous
    Strategic 15min.  I've found that forcing myself to look at the bigger picture for 15 minutes, changes my approach to the day and the week.

## SOMEDAY MAYBE

The brain is on a constant loop, forged from our beginnings of humanity it continually cycles to remember food, shelter, water, and actions of how to survive.  Now that loop serves as a reminder of errands, friends you should call and that one place you should try, what was that place again?

To stop the loop, capture strategic but not urgent tasks in the someday maybe box, cross them out later or collect them into a larger category to look back on when you might have time.  
NOTES

Taking notes throughout the day serves as a space for quick mental math, topics for meetings or just thoughts.  But they serve a particularly important purpose in meetings, mainly *the medium on which you take notes is essential.*  

    Paper = Yes, I'm listening to you and fully present.
    Laptop = Yes, I hear you, but our physical communication is not as important as asynchronous communication (slack, email, facebook etc.)  
    Phone = Fuck if I care, you will summarize it again anyway when I ask you to repeat it.

## THIS WEEK THIS WEEKEND

Tiny space for a tiny nudge, to mentally track important semi-urgent things that can likely be delegated or carried over to another day, but are not to be forgotten.  

## BONUS: You need a digital version

This set up of a to-do list has served me well, but it's not enough.  It's not the most convenient thing to carry around and has its limitations on weekends.  I keep other items and reminders on my phone using THINGS with a similar folder and structure as the physical version.  Yes, there are duplicates, but that also means you get twice the satisfaction when completing things.
